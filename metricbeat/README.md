# Welcome to Metricbeat 6.5.4

Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper for metrics.

## Getting Started

To get started with Metricbeat, you need to set up Elasticsearch on
your localhost first. After that, start Metricbeat with:

     ./metricbeat -c metricbeat.yml -e

This will start Metricbeat and send the data to your Elasticsearch
instance. To load the dashboards for Metricbeat into Kibana, run:

    ./metricbeat setup -e
